# Campfire is an interaction system built on top of Markdown.

Organize your content in **cards**, then link to different cards with 
special %{hyperlinks}(start2).

## Cards

A card a combination of Markdown and Campfire expressions. 

Let's look at a %{basic card}(basic_card) that does absolutely nothing:

$end 
$begin basic_card 

```
$begin my_card
Hello, world!
$end
```

All Campfire cards start with the `$begin` %{command}(commands), which takes one argument: an 
alphanumeric card identifier. This identifer is unique to the card, and is the same 
identifier used when creating %{Campfire links}(links).


$end
$begin links 

Campfire links render a new card. 

For example, if I had the following card:

```
$ begin some_card

Lorem ipsum

$ end
```

I could create a Campfire link and render that card in a different card 
like this: 

```
A % {link}(some_card) to the card.
```

$end 

$begin commands 

Commands always start with $, and will generally have the following format: 

```
$<command> <param> [=] [<value>]
```

For example, each card starts with the $ begin command and ends with the $ end
command. 

$end

$begin basic_examples 

Card content is written in Campfire, which is basically just Markdown with some 
fancy custom tags that do things.

So **most** normal Markdown syntax will just _work_; you can always see the 
[language cheatsheet](https://campfirejs.org/cheatsheet).

$begin neato_burrito

Ha! This is a silly card.
